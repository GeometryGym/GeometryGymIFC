# GeometryGymIFC
C# classes to generate and parse OpenBIM IFC (Industry Foundation Class) files

These classes simultaneously support IFC2x3, IFC4 and Infrastructure proposals 
for IFC5, and are easily extended for experimental extensions.

Documentation on these classes is available on Building Smart websites, such as
http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC4/Add1/html/ (Browse Alphabetical Listings)

Projects to demonstrate the classes include

Please contact me in advance of making significant changes to the core code, as 
it's possible existing code might be ported to the open source repository if I've
already implemented it.
